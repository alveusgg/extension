# Releasing a new version on Twitch

First and foremost, we need to establish the new version number. Compare `main` to the most recent tagged version in the repository and decide if the release is a minor (new features) or patch (bug fixes) release. The commit being submitted to Twitch should be tagged via git with `git tag v<version>` if you're currently at the commit being used, or `git tag v<version> <commit>` if not. Once the tag is created, push it with `git push origin v<version>`.

## Local test

All new versions start in local test where the base URI is `https://localhost:8080/`, allowing a locally run version to be tested.

The "panel viewer path" should be `panel.html`, the "mobile viewer path" as `mobile.html`, and "video - fullscreen viewer path" as `video_overlay.html`.

Ensure that the allowlist for image domains is set to allow `https://www.alveussanctuary.org` for ambassador images, the allowlist for media domains is set to allow `https://fonts.googleapis.com/` for fonts, and that allowlist for URL fetching domains is set to include `wss://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv:443`, `ws://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv:80`, `irc://irc.chat.twitch.tv:6667`, `irc://irc.chat.twitch.tv:6697` to allow connecting to chat as well as `https://ext.alveussanctuary.org` to allow fetching ambassador data.

## Hosted test

Once local testing is complete, a build can be created with `pnpm build`. The resulting [`build/build.zip`](build/build.zip) (an archive of all files within the `build` directory) can be uploaded to Twitch for hosted testing.

With the assets hosted on Twitch, install the extension version on a test channel and verify that everything is working as expected when running from Twitch.

## Submit for review

With the extension installed on a test channel, submit the extension for review, providing the URL for the channel to use for testing.

Include the walkthrough guide for the extension, with an updated changelog of what changed since the last version submitted:

Note: "ambassadors" are the animals displayed in the extension (they are educational ambassadors for their species).

This extension displays information about ambassadors at Alveus Sanctuary within the Panel and Overlay view.
It is designed to be used by channels that are hosting collaboration streams at Alveus.
It allows viewers to explore more information about the ambassadors seen on the stream, at any time.
It allows the broadcaster/moderators to run chat commands to display information about specific ambassadors to everyone, as they are shown on stream.

This extension is made with React, and is bundled with Webpack.
Due to the nature (frequency and last-minute-ness) of collaboration streams, it is not tenable to maintain an access list and create new releases for each collaboration, so this is published as a global overlay.
